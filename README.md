# GBChess

This started as an initial attempt to write a basic chess program, where GPT-4 writes all C++ code
based of my prompts. My initial commits include the prompt used. The organization into files as well
as the Makefile has been done by me. The goal is to learn about using LLMs to write code.
I tried to keep things simple to avoid confusing the AI.

After discovering the limitations of a conversation with ChatGPT, starting with commit dda04074f on
November 21, 2023, I switched to just using GitHub Copilot where it makes sense, but wrote more of
the code myself.
