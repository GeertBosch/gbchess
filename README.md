# GBChess

This project started as an initial attempt to write a basic chess program, where GPT-4 writes all
C++ code based of my prompts. My initial commits include the prompt used. The organization into
files as well as the Makefile has been done by me. The goal is to learn about using LLMs to write
code. I tried to keep things simple to avoid confusing the AI.

After discovering the limitations of a conversation with ChatGPT, starting with commit dda04074f on
November 21, 2023, I switched to just using GitHub Copilot where it makes sense, but wrote more of
the code myself.

Starting with commit commit 6787b73d on June 30, 2025, I used Claude to write some of the NNUE input
transform. From that point onwards, I have used the Claude agent frequently.

## notes about choices made in this project

This project is for fun and learning. So here you'll find an unnatural bias toward unconventional
choices, really as an opposition to what we know is the right thing on average for our day jobs.
Within this experiment around using LLMs as coding assistants, there are a host of smaller unnamed
and undisclosed sub-experiments, hidden in plain sight. When you see some of these choices and think
I should know better, thank you for you faith. Yes, but even where I do, I might want to relive and
relearn the why, or just delight in just the "what if I don't". Here, it's all fun and games.
