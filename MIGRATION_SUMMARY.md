     - En passant captures (including edge cases)
     - Pawn promotions to all piece types
     - Complex tactical and middlegame positions
   - **Target depths 4-6** (avoiding 128-bit requirements)
   - **Performance comparison** with C++ implementation

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Compare Rust vs C++ move generation speed
   - Identify any performance regressions
   - Optimize critical paths if needed

### Short-term (Next 1-2 weeks)
3. **Begin eval Migration**
   - Start with basic piece-square evaluation
   - Port evaluation tables and functions
   - Maintain compatibility with existing test positions

4. **Integration Testing**

   - Ensure identical behavior across all test cases

### Medium-term (Next 4-6 weeks)
5. **Complete nnue, search, and uci Components**
6. **Full Engine Integration**
7. **Performance Optimization**
8. **Final Validation and C++ Removal**

- Build system and testing framework
- Basic functionality and correctness

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Conclusion

The Rust migration is progressing excellently with all core move generation components completed and validated. The recent fixes have addressed critical safety and correctness issues, and the perft testing confirms that move generation is working properly. 

**We are ready to proceed with comprehensive perft testing and performance validation before moving on to the evaluation components.**
