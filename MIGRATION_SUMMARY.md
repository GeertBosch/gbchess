## Next Steps (Priority Order) 🎯

## Immediate Next Steps 🎯

### Current Priority: Search Algorithm (`search`)

With move generation and evaluation fully validated, the next critical component is **search algorithm
implementation**. This is the final major component needed for a functional chess engine.

**Why search is critical:**
- Provides the "brain" of the chess engine - ability to find best moves
- Implements alpha-beta pruning for efficient position analysis
- Integrates move generation and evaluation into complete game-playing capability
- Required for UCI protocol and external interface

**Implementation approach:**
1. **Start with C++ `search.cpp` analysis** - understand current search logic
2. **Port alpha-beta algorithm** - core minimax search with pruning
3. **Add quiescence search** - tactical extension for capture sequences  
4. **Implement move ordering** - optimize search using evaluation
5. **Validate with test positions** - ensure search consistency and correctness

## Conclusion

The Rust migration is progressing excellently with all core move generation and position evaluation
components completed and fully validated. The comprehensive perft testing confirmed that our move 
generation is 100% correct, and the evaluation system produces identical results to the C++ version.

**We are ready to proceed with the search algorithm (`search`) component implementation, which is now the
critical path for completing a functional chess engine.** The foundation of move generation and 
evaluation is solid and ready to support advanced search algorithms.
