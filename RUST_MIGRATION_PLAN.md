# Rust Migration Plan for GB Chess Engine

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to migrate the GB Chess Engine from C++ to Rust while maintaining the same functionality, organization, and coding style principles.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup and Hello World

### 1.1 Install Rust Toolchain
- Install `rustup` (Rust installer and version management tool)
- Install the latest stable Rust compiler
- Install `cargo` (Rust's build system and package manager)
- Set up VS Code extensions for Rust development

### 1.2 Project Structure Setup
- Create `Cargo.toml` workspace file in the root directory
- Create `rust/` directory to house Rust code alongside existing `src/` (C++)
- Set up workspace with multiple crates for different components
- Configure build system to produce executables in `build/` directory

### 1.3 Hello World Verification
- Create a simple "Hello, World!" Rust program
- Verify compilation and execution
- Test cargo build system integration

## Phase 2: First Migration - ELO Test

### 2.1 Analyze elo_test.cpp
- Review current C++ implementation
- Identify dependencies and data structures
- Map C++ concepts to Rust equivalents

### 2.2 Create Rust ELO Test Crate
- Set up `elo-test` crate in `rust/elo-test/`
- Implement basic structure following C++ organization
- Apply coding style: early returns, minimal nesting, small functions

### 2.3 Port Core Functionality
- Convert main ELO calculation logic
- Implement equivalent data structures using Rust idioms
- Maintain same command-line interface and output format

## Phase 3: Incremental Component Migration

### 3.1 Priority Order for Migration
1. **elo_test** (standalone, good starter) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
2. **fen** (fundamental, used by many components) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
3. **hash** (utility component with clear interface) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
4. **square_set** (bitboard operations) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
5. **magic** (magic bitboard generation) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
6. **moves_table** (precomputed move tables) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
7. **moves** (core move logic) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
8. **moves_gen** (move generation algorithms) ‚è≥ NEXT
9. **perft** (move generation validation and testing) ‚è≥ HIGH PRIORITY
10. **eval** (evaluation functions) üìã PLANNED
11. **nnue** (neural network evaluation) üìã PLANNED
12. **search** (main search algorithm) üìã PLANNED
13. **uci** (UCI protocol implementation) üìã PLANNED

### 3.2 Migration Strategy per Component
- Create separate Rust crate for each major component
- Maintain C++ and Rust versions side-by-side during transition
- Use integration tests to verify equivalent behavior
- Gradually replace C++ dependencies with Rust equivalents

**Special Note on Perft**: The perft component is critical for validating move generation correctness. It performs exhaustive tree searches to count all possible moves at various depths, making it an excellent debugging tool for finding edge cases in move generation algorithms. This should be implemented immediately after moves_gen to catch any bugs early.

## Phase 4: Build System Integration

### 4.1 Cargo Workspace Configuration
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "rust/elo",
    "rust/fen",
    "rust/hash",
    "rust/magic",
    "rust/moves",
    "rust/moves_table",
    "rust/square_set",
    # Future components:
    # "rust/moves_gen",
    # "rust/perft",
    # "rust/eval",
    # "rust/nnue", 
    # "rust/search",
    # "rust/uci",
    # "rust/chess-engine"
]
```

### 4.2 Makefile Integration
- Update Makefile to build both C++ and Rust components
- Configure output to same `build/` directory
- Maintain existing test targets and workflows

### 4.3 Cross-Language Integration
- Use C FFI when needed for gradual migration
- Create wrapper functions for interfacing between C++ and Rust
- Plan for eventual complete replacement

## Phase 5: Rust-Specific Optimizations

### 5.1 Memory Management
- Leverage Rust's ownership system for safe memory management
- Replace manual memory management with RAII patterns
- Use `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc` appropriately for different ownership needs

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Use `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` instead of error codes
- Implement proper error propagation with `?` operator
- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors

### 5.3 Concurrency and Performance
- Use Rust's safe concurrency primitives where applicable
- Leverage zero-cost abstractions
- Apply SIMD optimizations using safe Rust libraries

### 5.4 Idiomatic Rust Patterns
- Use iterators and functional programming patterns
- Implement traits for common operations
- Use pattern matching for control flow
- Apply borrowing and lifetimes for efficient memory usage

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Port existing C++ unit tests to Rust using `cargo test`
- Maintain test coverage during migration
- Add Rust-specific tests for new functionality

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Verify identical behavior between C++ and Rust versions
- Use existing puzzle tests as integration benchmarks
- Performance comparison between implementations

### 6.3 Benchmarking
- Use `criterion` crate for Rust benchmarking
- Compare performance with C++ implementation
- Identify and address performance regressions

## Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup

### 7.1 Documentation
- Write comprehensive rustdoc documentation
- Update README with Rust build instructions
- Document migration lessons learned

### 7.2 Final Cleanup
- Remove C++ code once Rust equivalents are verified
- Consolidate build system to pure Rust
- Optimize final project structure

## Coding Style Guidelines for Rust Migration

### From C++ Principles to Rust
- **Early returns**: Use `?` operator and guard clauses
- **Small functions**: Maintain same function decomposition
- **Minimal nesting**: Use pattern matching and early returns
- **Documentation**: Use `///` for public APIs, avoid over-commenting trivial code

### Rust-Specific Guidelines
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for types and traits
- Prefer `match` over nested `if` statements
- Use `impl` blocks to organize related functionality
- Leverage type system for compile-time guarantees

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (setup and hello world)
- **Phase 2**: 3-5 days (elo-test migration)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (component-by-component migration)
- **Phase 4**: 3-5 days (build system integration)
- **Phase 5**: 1 week (Rust optimizations)
- **Phase 6**: 1 week (testing and validation)
- **Phase 7**: 2-3 days (documentation and cleanup)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-8 weeks for complete migration

## Success Criteria

1. All existing functionality preserved
2. Same command-line interfaces maintained
3. Performance equal to or better than C++ version
4. All tests passing
5. Clean, idiomatic Rust code
6. Comprehensive documentation
7. Streamlined build process

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1: Install Rust toolchain and set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement "Hello, World!" to verify setup
4. Start with elo-test migration as proof of concept

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fen/           # FEN parsing and board representation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hash/          # Zobrist hashing for positions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ magic/         # Magic bitboard generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moves/         # Core move operations and position updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moves_table/   # Move/capture table generation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ square_set/    # Bitboard square set operations
```

### In Progress
- None currently

### Remaining Components
